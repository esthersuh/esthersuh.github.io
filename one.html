    <p class="paragraph">"Gwangju National Museum was established to promote development of cultural arts and to foster patriotism. The museum’s construction began in 1977 and was open to public on December 6, 1978. Gwangju National Museum aims to conserve cultural values through collection and preservation of historical and valuable artifacts found in Gwangju and Jeollanam-do regions while making contributions to the community through continuous research, exhibition, and education.
      Inspired by traditional Korean architecture, Gwangju National Museum is a six story building with two stories above ground and four basement floors. The museum consists of spacious exhibition halls with a total area of 3,305m². A reconstruction took place in December 1996, repairing old facilities and adding two new exhibition halls, the Special Exhibition Hall and the Buddhist Art Exhibition Hall."
